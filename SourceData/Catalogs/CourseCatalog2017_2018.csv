AS,American Studies,ASAH 0441,Fine Art vs. Anti-Art: 1917 to 1967,3 Credits,,,,,"Dr. Wayne Craven writes in American Art: History and Culture, ""As the new century opened America was a nation in transition, and ripe for many kinds of revolutions - in politics, social systems, and certainly in literature and painting. [These] social shifting values and forces were occurring within American society at large."" Focusing on the 50 years from WWI to Vietnam, this class examines the artistic debates and ideological struggles manifested by American art. During this time, there is a shifting barometric needle of stylistic expression. On one side, we see an entrenched, traditionalist school that retains the noble beaux arts criteria for realism and classical content. Artists to be studied in this school are: Henri, Sloan, Hopper, Marsh, Cadmus, Benton, Curry, Wood, Sheeler, Demuth and Wyeth. On the other side of the aesthetic spectrum, we encounter rebels leading the avant-garde. Sparked by the new ""isms"" of European modernism, artists to be discussed include: Duchamp, Stella, Dove, O'Keeffe, Gorky, Pollock, Rothko, Frankenthaler, De Kooning, Motherwell. The culmination and convergence of these parallel tracks arrive with the neo-realist but equally avant-gardist Pop art movement of the 1960s. Warhol, Rosenquist, Johns, and Wessleman use hard-edge realism to convey anti-establishment parodies and camp spin-offs of high culture. The period between 1917-1967 becomes, then, the pivotal shift when traditionalism is converted into a new cultural paradigm ending modernism as a distinct period."
AS,American Studies,ASAH 0444,American Visual Art History,3 Credits,,,,,"This class focuses on a selection of American Masters who came to define the American experience as visual innovators reflecting and transforming their times.

Each artistic biography is presented as a filtered lens through which America's social, political, literary and economic themes are manifested in painterly expressions. Within this cultural framework, we examine the creative spirit of each age in the American experience. The course combines classroom illustrated slide lectures, discussions, and field trips to study on-site major collections of American art at museums including: The Yale University Art Gallery, Wadsworth Atheneum, New Britain Museum of American Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Whitney Museum of American Art."

AS,American Studies,ASIT 0481,Visions of Italy and America in Film,3 Credits,,,,,"Adaptations and critiques of genres and themes indicate cinematic health. Italian cinema, which has given rise to movements such as neorealism, commedia all'italiana, and the spaghetti western, has provided the original material for adaptations by directors from other countries, notably the United States. The prevalence of American adaptations is a measure of the artistic contribution of the Italian national cinema. In this course we examine the phenomenon of adaptation and interpretation of Italian films from the postwar period until today. After a condensed review of more than 60 years of Italian cinematic history, we examine several American interpretations of Italian film classics. Garnett's The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), based upon James Cain's novel, revisits Visconti's Ossessione (1943). Neil Simon's Sweet Charity (1966) and later Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) re-tell Fellini's tragic tale of Le notti di Cabiria (1957). More subtle parallels are found in Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000) and Fellini's Lo sciecco bianco (1956). Brian DePalma's Blow Out (1981), starring John Travolta, maintains the premise of Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). Madonna and Guy Ritchie's 2002 remake of Swept Away (1974), as well as Garry Marshall's adaptation Overboard (1987), reveal the impact of Wertmuller's original. These American reflections on Italian films, themselves dark mirrors reflecting on the themes and assumptions of American film hegemony, offer another means to appreciate the powerful insights of self-reflection in the Italian postwar period."

This course concentrates on the varying experiences (based on class, race, and ethnic differences) of women in the workplace and on the playing field. Sex segregation and sex integration as complex historical and contemporary processes constitute the main focus of the first part of the course.

Their varied experiences in this world parallel to a large extent their experiences within the workplace. The underlying theme is that the sports arena mirrors the larger society particularly in terms of gender roles. What is seen as ""acceptable and non-acceptable"" behavior for women in the everyday world is reflected in their roles as athletes. The impact of gender on socializing children into sport and sport itself as a socializing agency is the foundation for critically assessing the outcomes of Title IX and the existence of homophobia in sport."
